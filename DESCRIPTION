Description: Energy decomposition analysis for measuring contributions of components
             and factors on energy or carbon emission changes, as described in 
             B.W. Ang (2005) <doi:10.1016/j.enpol.2003.10.010>. Includes Log Mean 
             Devisia Index method and multi-year energy decomposition analysis using 
             five methods. Please refer P. Wu (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.200> 
             to use the package.
